		headline="You form `partnerships` with your colleagues."
		text1="*Offering opportunities, encouraging employees:* For SinnerSchrader, these are important components for success. You form partnerships with your colleagues, ideally in the long term. You accompany them on their journey and ensure that they succeed. They learn to take responsibility and can trust that they’ll receive all the support they need to achieve their goal. Then every door will be open to them."
		text2="*For Julie-Anne Sievers, these are the things that matter.* She learned early on from her mother – who founded her own company while raising four children on her own at the same time – that the world was open to her, and that you can accomplish a lot with courage and perseverance. While studying business administration, she completed an internship at SinnerSchrader Commerce. She immediately felt comfortable with project management, and she was able to write her bachelor’s thesis at the company. What’s more: right after she graduated, Julie-Anne was offered a job."

	<Story1
		headline="The move came at the `perfect` time"
		copy="*In the first few years, she learned intensively about the agency business.* “I actually wanted to go into strategy,” Julie-Anne says. “But instead I ended up in Prague for six months.” The move came at the perfect time, because she had been toying with the idea of gaining experience in a different city. She feels that being sent abroad at once was a bonus."

	<Story3
		headline="Her aim is to work with clients to `turn` the right wheels"
		copy="*As a project manager in Prague, Julie-Anne looks after the interests of clients such as HSE24 in Munich.* As a consultant, she advises clients, observes processes on site, and provides tips for improving workflows. Her aim is to work with clients to turn the right wheels and optimise processes. The technical knowledge she acquired during her earlier years at the digital agency is helpful here."

	<Story1
		headline="She’s an `interpreter` who translates clients"
		copy="*“I’m a generalist. I coordinate information and prepare it for clients so I can recommend a course of action,” Julie-Anne says.* You could also say she’s an interpreter who translates clients’ requests for the developers and explains the possibilities to the client. Her strength – motivating colleagues and clients and moving things forward in a positive way – was recognised by SinnerSchrader – who distinguished her as the best generator of impulses. There’s something else that appeals to her about the work in Prague, too. “I think it’s fantastic that I’ve been able to improve my English a lot here.” This is because employees from various countries work in Prague, so the agency language is English."

	<Story3
		headline="So many wonderful `opportunities` at SinnerSchrader."
		copy="*The half-year ended a long time ago, but Julie-Anne’s responsibilities haven’t.* She sees this as a great opportunity. “I can really live life to the fullest here, and I have a lot of freedom.” Above all, she’s made friends here now. But when asked where her professional journey will take her next, Julie-Anne starts to ponder. “There are so many wonderful opportunities at SinnerSchrader.” Although she cherishes her home and being close to family and friends, she feels an intense longing for other countries and can imagine staying in Prague. But she could also get excited about very different jobs as well. One option would immediately win her over: “If SinnerSchrader intended to open a site in Copenhagen – I’d be right there!”"
