		headline="From the `Bay Area` to Bavaria."
		copy="*Germany isn’t so far away from Silicon Valley.* At least, that’s the opinion of Adam Christian, site manager for SinnerSchrader in Munich. He’s excited by the start-up feeling at the agency, the joy of experimentation, and a passion for new technologies. He brought a lot of ideas with him from the USA, so it always feels like it’s “still day one”. This is what Adam Christian has to say …"

	<Story1
		headline="... about his `love` of technology:"
		copy="*I come from a small scenic city in Washington State north of Seattle called Bellingham.* Due to the proximity to Microsoft, I had access to visit the Microsoft campus and could always get my hands on their new software through friends and family. My grandfather founded a very successful company in Los Angeles distributing semiconductors, so I grew up inspired by the concepts of technology and entrepreneurship. I was lucky and had access to technology early on, and spent a lot of time as a kid building computers and learning to program. My parents were very understanding and supportive of my passion, regularly allowing me play with Unix late into the night."

			copy="*I always wanted to go to California to work at an early stage start-up building something innovative with cutting edge technology.* Once I arrived there I had the opportunity to immerse myself in the tech culture, endless meetups, hackathons, product launches, it was exactly what I wanted as a young developer. In many ways, I actually managed to fulfill the dream I had created for myself – I guess it's time to create a new one."

		headline="... about `SinnerSchrader:`"
		text1="*I’d known about SinnerSchrader for quite a while through JSConf EU.* The company’s vision always interested and excited me. Companies with a long product history often face the challenge of making the leap to the digital future, and need help and direction to evolve. SinnerSchrader can provide the technical and cultural groundwork allowing these companies to can focus on what they do best. I think it’s really important to have a company like SinnerSchrader out there filling this need, and I am excited to help make companies fit for the future."
        headline2="... about `Germany:`"
		text2="*I wanted to expand my horizons and find a place in the world that corresponded to my idea of the good life.* I decided on Germany and started to learn the language. Four years ago, I spoke at SinnerSchrader in German about software automation. I’m excited by the Germans and their way of viewing the world. My wife and I have particularly fallen in love with Munich, with the mountains, the surroundings, the people."

	<Story1
		headline="... about the `difference` between Silicon Valley and Germany:"
		copy="*One of the advantages of the Bay Area is that companies such as Facebook and Google provide a lot of resources for experimentation that will shape the future, constantly attracting top tier developers from all over the world.* The German working culture seems to operate generally more conservatively, potentially leading to slower product and technology development. And although Germany doesn’t have the density of developers that the Bay Area does, there are plenty of top tier developers building more interesting technology all the time."

	<Story1
		headline="... about new `clients`:"
		copy="*One of the tasks of a start-up is to keep the developers happy while simultaneously creating the new features demanded by sales and marketing.* So I had to maintain a balance between the requirements of the product and the economic factor – while developing high-quality software at the same time. My work at SinnerSchrader is very similar. At the end of the day, we have to develop good solutions and dispel a company’s fear of change."

	<Story1
		headline="... about his `favourite` places:"
		copy="*We take every opportunity to explore the surrounding area.* Munich is such a beautiful place and the climate is a lot like back home. We love to ski and definitely want to conquer the Alps. Munich and it’s proximity to the mountains feels even more like where I grew up than San Francisco did."
