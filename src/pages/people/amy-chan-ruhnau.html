		headline="“Still day one” is a `value` that the company puts into practice."
		text1="*For 20 years, clients have viewed SinnerSchrader as a reliable partner because the agency continually reinvents itself.* “Still day one” is a value that the company puts into practice. Never standing still, continually detecting new currents, identifying trends but also setting them – in the digital transformation, these are important prerequisites for lasting success. This wins over new clients as well. Just in time for its 20th birthday, SinnerSchrader was chosen by Audi as its leading digital agency. Together the companies will take the carmaker’s traditional values into the digital future."
		text2="*For Amy Chan-Ruhnau, who works on the Audi team, this fits perfectly.* Continuous change is her main driving force. After studying design in Sydney and gaining her first agency experience, she worked for Sony for five years. From there she went to Hong Kong to establish a strategy team for an agency. “You have to take the opportunities you’re given – who knows if they’ll come around again,” Amy says. She stayed in Hong Kong for two years – and then made a dream come true: she moved to London and got a job with Mediacom. For the next two years, she dealt with the question of how to get advertisements onto mobile phones and how new media formats can be used."

		copy="*Sydney, Hong Kong, London. How did Hamburg fit into this list?* The place wasn’t decisive for Amy – even though she missed the hustle and bustle of the metropolises a bit. “I’m a big-city girl,” she says. At SinnerSchrader, it’s the work that entices her. As a strategist, she’s instrumental in shaping the digital future of clients. The same applies to her actual job. SinnerSchrader offers the right environment for this. Employees such as Amy are encouraged to follow their own path – even if it means that the job turns into a long-distance relationship. Because Amy’s next stop was already set: Berlin. The capital is one of her favourite cities – because there’s something new to discover every day. “I almost never go to the same restaurant twice. I need change because it inspires me,” Amy says. “It’s fantastic that I have the opportunity to work from Berlin.” Nonetheless, she’s often together with her team, and she visits Hamburg at least once a week."
