		headline="`Drawing` grounds him and clears his head."
		text1="*He gets his motivation from the analogue world.* A pencil and a Moleskine sketchbook – Daniel doesn’t need anything else. The pencil is not so much a tool for him as an extension of his thoughts. He moves his hand expertly across the page as he brings people, places, and fabulous creatures into being. Drawing grounds him and clears his head. Sometimes he gets on his bike and cycles to the Taunus mountains, where he sits on one of the many hills, gazes into the distance – and starts to draw."
		text2="*Daniel Lichtmeß is originally from the Saarland.* He knew at an early age that he eventually wanted to do something with design. So he rode 100 kilometres on the train every day to attend a technical college – where he completed his training with honours as the best in his class. After finishing his civil service, he studied at Trier University of Applied Sciences, where he focused on illustration and typography. Thousands of drawings and countless typefaces later, he discovered motion design. He was fascinated by bringing things to life on the computer and giving them functions."

		headline="He was enticed by the `combination` of creation and technology."
		copy="*He lived in Frankfurt with his girlfriend and commuted to an agency in Cologne every day,* where he made his first attempt at the development of digital services. He was eventually hired by Razorfish in Frankfurt, where he stayed for six years. It was an educational period, and he won many awards for his work. Through his girlfriend, who worked at SinnerSchrader, he got to know and like a number of her colleagues. They would meet after work. So it felt like a logical step for Daniel to accept the offer of a job as Senior Art Director. He was enticed by the combination of creation and technology and the opportunity to develop something for the future."

	<Story3
		headline="You very `quickly` get good feedback."
		copy="*Daniel has arrived.* When the team spirit is right, he says, the output is all the better. Around 50 employees work on a single floor at the Frankfurt site. It’s a bit like a start-up. That’s due largely to the very informal atmosphere. He appreciates the short communication channels in the company. If you approach the management with requests or ideas, you very quickly get good feedback that you can work with. If you want to change something, it happens more easily and much faster than in other agencies. It’s not just the way of working that excites Daniel, however, but also the projects he works on."

		headline="And one thing is `always` with him: his sketchbook."
		copy="*Clients such as Deutsche Bank and ERGO have great potential.* He wants to give them even better proactive support in their digital transformation. For Daniel, this provides a lot of motivation – in view of the future as well. He wants to continue living and working in Frankfurt – his parents are just two hours away, and the landscape outside his front door is perfect for a nature fanatic. He loves mountain biking. He conquers every hill in the vicinity and then races down the slopes on his bike. And one thing is always with him: his sketchbook."
