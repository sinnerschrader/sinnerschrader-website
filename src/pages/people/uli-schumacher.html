		headline="The agency has a `family` atmosphere."
		text1="*In the hallways of SinnerSchrader in Hamburg, Berlin, Munich, or Frankfurt, you’ll always hear the same thing:* The agency has a family atmosphere. And like any family, there is a clear division of roles. One person is responsible for finances, another perhaps for making sure the refrigerator is full. And there’s always someone who carries the others along. Uli Schumacher is this person. He’s been a Technical Director at SinnerSchrader for three years. But does this mean he pushes himself to the foreground? Absolutely not. He often only realises in hindsight that he’s the one who has kept things going. He doesn’t brood for a long time about doing something – he just does it. “There’s so much freedom here. If you’re willing to accept responsibility, you can make good use of this freedom,” Uli says."
		text2="*“I grew up with computers, but my goal was actually to be a designer.”* He used Photoshop to design flyers for events, and he applied to train as a media designer at an agency with a website he designed himself. But the agency was more enthusiastic about his programming skills than his designs – so they trained him as a developer. Uli went freelance immediately afterward. He built intranet systems for agencies and programmed data administration systems, enterprise resource tools and kiosk applications. But despite the interesting jobs, he missed the interaction with colleagues, the teamwork on exciting projects. Independent work, client-oriented thinking, and, of course, a high degree of technical competence. SinnerSchrader recognised Uli’s potential. His job interview focused not only on his qualifications, but on what makes him tick. That impressed him. “The nice thing here is that it’s a community that supports you. I learned more in my first six months here than I had in the six previous years of work.”"

	<Story1
		headline="I’m most interested in `personal` drive."
		copy="*Today Uli conducts job interviews himself.* “I’m most interested in personal drive.” It’s important to have potential. But no one can teach the human side of things – and these are also qualities that are nurtured. “At some point, I was offered my current position. At first I wasn’t sure whether I could do it, whether I was the right type or whether I could fill the role.” He’s been a team leader for three years – and it’s clear why he was given this job: Uli is an empathic person, something that’s very helpful in a position with responsibility for others. He’s also technically experienced, and he’s good at talking to clients. It makes sense that he was invited to help set up the Munich site in order to work more closely with client Allianz."

	<Story3
		headline="He likes it when things `click` with people."
		copy="*Above all, he enjoys seeing his colleagues develop.* Uli says a few of his team members surpassed him technically a long time ago. But that just spurs him on. “I still know enough to be able to share my experience with beginners,” Uli laughs. He likes it when things click with people and they want to try out new things. This is in keeping with the motto of “Go for it!”."

	<Story1
		headline="You can’t tell who the `boss` is"
		copy="*Like most developers, he always wants to try out new things.* “You have so many opportunities to help shape things here.” Most of all, Uli wants to encourage young employees to seize opportunities themselves. For him, the greatest achievement would be to make his own role as a team leader superfluous. “Titles aren’t important to me. When you’re standing at the coffee maker, you can’t tell who the boss is.” Uli himself says that, at the end of the day, he’s just a cog in the machine. But these cogs are what keep everything running."
