In 2006, Schrader founded the NEXT Conference which has become the leading symposium for digital transformation in Europe. Today, the author, with his team of more than 500 consultants, designers and software engineers, continues to assist many large DAX index companies to develop cutting-edge digital products."

We believe more in the magic of an experienced, well-rehearsed and cunning clan. No alpha leaders, no beta teams. And if we can say at the end of the day that we had fun, it has been a good day. We see leadership as the power of a great sporting collective. We have written this book as an invitation to like-minded people."
