	<Case1
		headline="Meeting the `demands` of the youth."
		text1="*Fifteen years ago when Deutsche Bank, together with SinnerSchrader, launched maxblue, it helped pioneer the online trading services in Germany.* It disrupted the trading world, giving investors the opportunity to trade with efficiency for the first time. Over a decade later, we were asked to relaunch history, to meet the needs of today’s investor. Investors who are more technologically savvy, with many different devices and sky-high expectations."
		text2="*Prompted by the explosion of online FinTech services, young and inexperienced investors were rapidly becoming a core segment.* Via eleven interviews, we learnt that they struggled to sift through complex information to find a starting point to their investment adventures. Yet they desired to be self-directed, with full control of their portfolios and risk-taking. We saw this as a big opportunity to build a guiding and informative experience that boosts beginners’ confidence."

	<Story1
		headline="Putting on the user’s lens."
		copy="*The approach to meet our user’s needs was to be the user.* So we put on our users’ lenses, deconstructed their investment journey and then rethought the whole thing. We co-created with customers, clients and a multidisciplinary team, through an iterative service design process of eleven in-depth customer interviews, creative brainstorming and rapid prototyping."

	<Story3
		headline="Making `things` simple."
		copy="*Our solution was to transform the trading service into a self-directed and educational experience.* Core to this was to keep things simple for the user. A new UX concept was designed that quickly guided users to relevant information. A team was set up to fuel a new ‘Investment Trends’ content section with frequent and valuable articles. And expert copywriters were hired to transform complex jargon into easily digestible pieces."
