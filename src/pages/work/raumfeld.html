		copy="*Raumfeld, a renowned producer of wireless audio systems since 2008, recognised that the way consumers listened to music at home had changed and that their central controller, a smartphone app, was no longer adequate – neither structurally nor, functionally nor aesthetically - to satisfy their customers.* Raumfeld asked SinnerSchrader to help them optimise the outdated software structure to enable a reinvigoration of home music entertainment for a relaunch."

		headline="Designing the `mood` for music."
		copy="*Consumers simply wanted to enjoy their music. Nothing more, nothing less.* So, we set out to cater to this by making things effortless, streamlined and beautiful. We designed a user experience that made everything one click, swipe or tap away. Navigation and filters enabled users to find their tracks quickly. An always visible centrepiece, the Miniplayer, was used for quick multiroom overviews and track control. And, a modern visual design language, such a large images, high contrast and animated transitions, aimed to amplify the emotional experience of music entertainment."
