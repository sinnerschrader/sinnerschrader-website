	<Case2
		copy="*Europa-Park in Germay is one of the largest theme parks in Europe.* Each year almost 5 million people go for the fun, thrill and entertainment. But theme park experiences were no longer just about the rollercoaster ride. As customers increasingly expected digitally enhanced services, Europa-Park needed to boost the whole park experience â€“ and their app could no longer support this. They asked SinnerSchrader to collaborate  to find new ways to deliver more value to the customer with a relaunch of the app."

	<Story3
		headline="Go, `go`, go content."
		copy="*Customers told us they felt somewhat anxious and frantic when in a theme park.* There was so much to do in so little time. We asked ourselves: what if we could escort them through the park to help make their journey more enjoyable? So we built a contextualised newsfeed that pushed relevant notifications throughout their journey, such as hotel bookings, shortest waiting lines and closest restaurants, making customersâ€™ experiences more simple and less frantic."

	<Case3
		headline="More content, `less` clutter."
		copy="*We dug deep into customer journeys to uncover moments of anxiety and find ways to alleviate them.* Through the use of stories based on multiple persona, we compiled a logic of needs before, during and after park visits and matched them with a flow of relevant content and notifications. To minimise clutter, we introduced a new modular UI structure using a card-based system for easy access to relevant information."

		headline="Tackling `complexity` with collaboration."
		copy="*One of the greatest challenges of the project was to integrate 200+ backend systems.* Second to this was to create an app that was self-updating without the need to install a new version. This technically complicated task not only required a large team of highly skilled developers, but also a collaborative and communicative interdisciplinary team, on both sides of the partnership."
